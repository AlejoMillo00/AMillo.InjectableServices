## About The Project

Are you tired of large Program.cs / Startup.cs files, with lots and lots of service dependency injections? Well...You are lucky!

InjectableServices is a simple feature that allows you to register your services without having to add them to the Program / Startup file, keeping them clean and smooth.

Here's why this is good:
* Cleaner and readable Program / Startup files, keep them small.
* Make your services ready-to-use just as you finish creating them, you don't even need to go into the Program / Startup file.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Install the package
   ```sh
   Install-Package AMillo.InjectableServices
   ```
2. Call the AddInjectableServices() extension method from AMillo.InjectableServices directive in your Program.cs / Startup.cs file <br/>

## Usage
7
Now that you installed the package and set up the feature in your Program.cs / Startup.cs file, you can start creating your services and registering them as follows:

1. Mark your service interface with the <strong>[InjectableService]</strong> attribute. <br/>
   ![image](https://github.com/AlejoMillo00/AMillo.InjectableServices/assets/43641714/8a6b058c-8bbd-452b-a6cb-a59a4d7a4b21) <br />
2. That's it! Your service will ge registered automatically on startup.

### Service Lifetime
By default, the <strong>[InjectableService]</strong> attribute will register your services as <strong>"Scoped"</strong>. 
<br />
But if you want, you can specify the lifetime for your service as follows: 
<br/>

1. Mark your service interface with the <strong>[InjectableService]</strong> attribute passing the lifetime to the attribute's constructor. <br />
   ![image](https://github.com/AlejoMillo00/AMillo.InjectableServices/assets/43641714/88636125-7f89-4330-ad98-7dcdc851575d) <br />
2. That's it! Now your service will get register as Transient automatically on startup.

<br >
You can pass <strong>Scoped (default), Transient or Singleton</strong> as values for the <strong>[InjectableService]</strong> attribute's constructor, basically the <strong>ServiceLifetime</strong> enum values.
