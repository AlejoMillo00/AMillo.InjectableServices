## About The Project

Are you tired of large Program.cs / Startup.cs files, with lots and lots of service dependency injections? Well...You are lucky!

InjectableServices is a simple feature that allows you to register your services without having to add them to the Program / Startup file, keeping them clean and smooth.

Here's why this is good:
* Cleaner and readable Program / Startup files, keep them small.
* Make your services ready-to-use just as you finish creating them, you don't even need to go into the Program / Startup file.

## Getting Started
### Installation
- .NET CLI
  ```sh
  dotnet add package AMillo.InjectableServices --version 2.0.0
  ```
- Package Manager
  ```sh
  Install-Package AMillo.InjectableServices -Version 2.0.0
  ```
### Usage
1. Add the following <strong>using</strong> directive on your Program.cs / Startup.cs file
   ```sh
   using AMillo.InjectableServices.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
   ```
2. Call the <strong>AddInjectableServices</strong> extension method using one of the following overloads
   - AddInjectableServices()
     ```sh
     //Look for injectable services inside all assemblies for current AppDomain
     builder.Services.AddInjectableServices(); 
     ```
   - AddInjectableServicesFromAssemblies(Assembly[] assemblies)
     ```sh
     //Look for injectable services inside the specified assemblies
     builder.Services.AddInjectableServicesFromAssemblies(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies());
     ```
   - AddInjectableServicesFromAssembly(Assembly assembly)
     ```sh
     //Look for injectable services inside a single specified assembly
     builder.Services.AddInjectableServicesFromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly); 
     ```

3. Mark your service interface with the <strong>[InjectableService]</strong> attribute.
   ```sh
    [InjectableService] //Scoped by default
    internal interface IDemoService
    {
        string GetHelloWorld();
    }
    
    internal sealed class DemoService : IDemoService
    {
        public string GetHelloWorld()
        {
            return "Hello World!";
        }
    }
   ```
   
4. That's it! Your service will get registered automatically at startup.

### Service Lifetime
By default, the <strong>[InjectableService]</strong> attribute will register your services as <strong>"Scoped"</strong>. 
<br />
But if you want, you can specify the lifetime for your service as follows: 
<br/>

1. Mark your service interface with the <strong>[InjectableService]</strong> attribute passing the lifetime to the attribute's constructor.
   ```sh
    //[InjectableService(Lifetime = ServiceLifetime.Singleton)] //For singleton
    //[InjectableService(Lifetime = ServiceLifetime.Transient)] //For transient
    [InjectableService(Lifetime = ServiceLifetime.Scoped)] //For scoped (default)
    internal interface IDemoService
    {
        string GetHelloWorld();
    }
   ```
2. That's it! Now your service will get register as Transient, Singleton or Scoped automatically on startup.
